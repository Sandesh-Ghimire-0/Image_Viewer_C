# Image viewer

This is a simple image viewing app made in C using SDL2 for GUI.

## Installation and Usecase example

You can clone this github repo and use the following command to view your PPM(Portable Pixmap Format) image. The image must be of PPM format.To convert an image to PPM you can use the GNU image manipulator for now. Later i might add the functionality for the support of all image format.

```bash
    cat file_name.ppm | ./iv
```
